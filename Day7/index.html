                <h1>Betelgeuse</h1>
                <p>Betelgeuse is the brightest star in Orion and marks the western shoulder of the constellation.
                    Betelgeuse is one of the largest known stars and is probably at least the size of the orbits of Mars
                    or Jupiter around the sun. That's a diameter about 700 times the size of the Sun or 600 million
                    miles.</p>

                <h1>Sirius</h1>
                <p>Sirius, brightest star in the night sky, with apparent visual magnitude −1.46. It is a binary star
                    in the constellation Canis Major. The bright component of the binary is a blue-white star 25.4 times
                    as luminous as the Sun.</p>

                <h1>Alpha & Proxima Centauri</h1>
                <p>Alpha Centauri C, better known as Proxima Centauri, is a small main-sequence red dwarf of spectral
                    class M6-Ve. It has an absolute magnitude of +15.60, over 20,000 times fainter than the Sun. Its
                    mass is calculated to be 0.1221 M ☉. It is the closest star to the Sun but is too faint to be
                    visible to the naked eye.</p>

                <p>Rigel is an intrinsic variable star with an apparent magnitude ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. It is
                    typically the seventh-brightest star in the celestial sphere, excluding the Sun, although
                    occasionally fainter than Betelgeuse. It is fainter than Capella, which may also vary slightly in
                    brightness.</p>

                <p>Vega is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. It has the Bayer designation α
                    Lyrae, which is Latinised to Alpha Lyrae and abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr. This star is relatively
                    close at only 25 light-years (7.7 parsecs) from the Sun, and one of the most luminous stars in the
                    Sun's neighborhood.</p>

                <h1>Antares</h1>
                <p>Antares is called a red supergiant due to its enormous size. Its diameter is 700 times larger than
                    the Sun. This means that if Antares was located at the center of the solar system, it would extend
                    to the orbit of Mars. However, the mass of Antares is between 12 and 18 times greater than that of
                    the Sun.</p>

                <p>Canopus is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina and the second-brightest star
                    in the night sky. It is also designated α Carinae, which is romanized (transliterated) to Alpha
                    Carinae. With a visual apparent magnitude of −0.74, it is outshone only by Sirius.</p>

                <p>Polaris is actually a triple star, the brighter of two visual components being a spectroscopic binary
                    with a period of about 30 years and a Cepheid variable with a period of about 4 days. Its changes in
                    brightness are too slight to be detected with the unaided eye.</p>

                    than 1,000 stars. They are located in the constellation Taurus and are about 410 light-years from
                    Earth.</p>
